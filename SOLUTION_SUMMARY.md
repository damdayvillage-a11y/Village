# Solution Summary: Admin Panel 500 Error Fix

## Problem Statement

User deployed the application to CapRover and encountered a "500500 Internal Server Error" when attempting to access the admin panel login at `/admin-panel/login`.

## Root Cause Analysis

While the repository already had comprehensive diagnostic tools and documentation, the issue was that:
1. Users encountering the 500 error didn't know where to find help
2. Error pages didn't provide direct links to diagnostic tools
3. No user-friendly, in-app guidance was immediately accessible
4. Hindi-speaking users (the target audience) had no localized help
