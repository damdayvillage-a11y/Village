## üîß If That Doesn't Work

### Diagnose the Problem

Run this command locally (or from any machine with curl):

```

Or use our diagnostic script:
```bash
npm run admin:diagnose https://your-domain.com
```

This will tell you exactly what's wrong:
- ‚ùå Environment variables not configured
- ‚ùå Database not connected
- ‚ùå Placeholders ($$cap_*$$) not replaced
- ‚ùå Admin user missing

### Common Issues & One-Line Fixes

**Issue 1: CapRover Placeholders Not Replaced**
```
Error: NEXTAUTH_URL contains placeholders like $$cap_appname$$
Fix: In CapRover dashboard, set NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com
```

**Issue 2: NEXTAUTH_SECRET Invalid**
```
Error: NEXTAUTH_SECRET is too short or contains dummy value
Fix: Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
     Then set in CapRover: NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<paste result>
```

**Issue 3: Database Not Connected**
```
Error: Database connection failed
Fix: Set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
     (Replace user, pass, host, db with actual values)
```

**Issue 4: Admin User Doesn't Exist**
```
Error: Admin user not found
Fix: Visit https://your-domain.com/api/admin/init
     OR run: npm run db:seed
```

## üîê Security Note

The default credentials (`admin@damdayvillage.org` / `Admin@123`) are intentionally simple for first-time setup. 

**You MUST:**
1. ‚úÖ Change the password immediately after first login
2. ‚úÖ Change the email address to your own
3. ‚úÖ Enable 2FA if available
4. ‚úÖ Review user permissions

**Optional:** Set custom default password via environment variable:
```bash
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123
```
