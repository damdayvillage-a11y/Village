## 🎯 Problem Statement (Original Request)

In this file, include 10 PRs for admin panel implementations and configurations so that our complete requirements and goals are achieved. The entire webapp, marketplace, carbon credits, etc., should all be manageable from the admin panel, and new implementations should also be possible from the admin panel.
