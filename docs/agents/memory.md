MEMORY UPDATE RULES:
- On PR merge, append to `completed_prs`: number, title, merge_commit, date, CI status, staging_url, prod_url (if deployed), screenshot paths, video paths, test coverage, Lighthouse scores, sensor sample snapshots, model metadata.
- For hardware features, capture a simulated telemetry snapshot and store sample device definitions in `iot_devices_sample`.
- On ML changes, store model artifact path and evaluation metrics in `model_versions`.
- On blockchain actions, store tx hashes (if in testnet) and contract addresses plus audit notes.
- For any failed CI/test or security flag, create an entry under `tasks_blocked` with remediation plan.
