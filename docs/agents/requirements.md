Project: Smart Carbon-Free Village — Futuristic Platform
Vision: Open Damday Village to the world as a carbon-neutral, culturally-rich, resilient, and technologically progressive model village. Provide immersive tourism, sustainable commerce, transparent development, community governance and real-time environmental stewardship.

Stakeholders:
- Village Council & local community
- Hosts & sellers
- Tourists & guests
- NGOs, funders and researchers
- Operators & admin team

Core Goals:
1. Showcase Damday through immersive UX (3D/digital twin, AR tours).
2. Offer secure bookings and marketplace (web2 + optional web3 escrow).
3. Provide transparent project & funding ledger (immutable record option).
4. Real-time environmental monitoring & carbon accounting using IoT sensors.
5. Solar microgrid monitoring & energy optimization dashboard.
6. Offline-first PWA and local caching for poor-connectivity visitors.
7. Admin panel for full operations and ML-model management.
8. Community governance tools (participatory budgeting, optional DAO).
9. Accessible, multilingual (English/Hindi + audio), SEO & privacy compliant.
10. CI/CD with CapRover, automated tests, monitoring, and rollback.

Futuristic Features (brief list):
- 3D Digital Twin (Cesium/Three.js or Mapbox + photogrammetry).
- AR guided tours (WebXR / 360 photos + hotspots).
- Interactive site with voice assistant (Speech-to-text + TTS + optional LLM integration for Q&A).
- IoT telemetry (MQTT → Time-series DB), device management, threshold alerts.
- Carbon accounting engine (sensor-based + estimated travel emissions + offset marketplace).
- Edge & offline-first PWA (service worker, sync queue, CRDT/OT for conflict resolution).
- WebRTC real-time chat + video for host-guest help and telemedicine.
- Web3 optional: funding transparency via smart contracts, IPFS backup for media.
- DAO-style voting mechanism for community project funding (optional).
- Drone delivery simulation for logistics (real drone ops require human approval).
- ML: personalized recommendations, demand forecasting, image moderation, accessibility auto-captioning.

Tech Stack (recommended / primary)
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Three.js, WebXR APIs
- Backend: Node.js (ts), NestJS or Express with Apollo GraphQL + REST
- Real-time: WebSockets / WebRTC / Redis pubsub
- Messaging & streaming: MQTT broker (Mosquitto) for devices, Kafka or RabbitMQ (optional)
- DBs:
  - Primary: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)
  - Time-series: TimescaleDB or InfluxDB for sensor data
  - Cache: Redis
  - Object storage: S3 / Cloudinary / MinIO (on-prem option)
- Authentication: NextAuth.js + JWT + optional DID/SSI for identity
- Payments: Stripe + Razorpay (web2); Web3 wallets & smart contracts (Polygon) optional
- Deployment/Infra: Docker, CapRover (primary), optional K8s/Helm for scale
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, OpenTelemetry
- ML infra: model registry, TF/PyTorch serving or model as service (optional)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with preview/staging/deploy workflows

Data Model (high-level)
- User { id, role, name, email, phone, DID?, locale, preferences }
- Village { id, geo, description, carbon_score, digital_twin_metadata }
- Homestay { id, ownerId, location, 3D_assets, amenities, calendar, dynamic_pricing_policy }
- Booking { id, homestayId, guestId, window, pricing_breakdown, status, payment_ref }
- Product/Order
- Project { id, ledger_entries[], progress, photos, funding_contract? }
- Device { id, type, location, last_seen, telemetry_schema, status }
- SensorReading { deviceId, timestamp, metrics... }
- DAO/Vote entities
- Media { url, checksum, ipfsCid?, tags }

Security & Privacy
- PII encryption at rest; TLS; CSP; XSS/SQL injection mitigations; OWASP.
- GDPR-style consent & data retention controls; cookie banner + policy.
- Smart contract audit requirement for any funds movement on-chain.

Acceptance Criteria (expanded)
- Booking & marketplace flows E2E tested and sandbox payments complete.
- Digital twin loads (3D) and AR/360 tours function in supported browsers.
- Sensor ingestion pipeline works with simulated devices; dashboard shows real-time telemetry.
- Carbon accounting engine computes per-activity carbon footprints and stores results.
- Admin can manage content, devices, projects, users, and ML model versions.
- CI runs lint/type-check/tests, Playwright E2E, Lighthouse, a11y checks, security scans.
- Memory artifacts (screenshots, telemetry snapshots, model metadata) stored after each PR.
