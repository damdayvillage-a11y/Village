## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to implement all 10 PRs?
**A**: Yes, all 10 PRs are necessary to achieve a fully functional admin panel. However, you can prioritize critical ones (PR #1, #2) first.

### Q: Can I change the implementation approach?
**A**: Yes, the document provides guidelines. You can adapt based on your needs, but ensure you meet the success criteria.

### Q: What if I encounter issues not covered in PR.md?
**A**: Document the issue, assess the solution, implement carefully, and update the relevant documentation.

### Q: How do I handle file references that don't exist?
**A**: Create them as specified. The document indicates which files to CREATE vs MODIFY.
