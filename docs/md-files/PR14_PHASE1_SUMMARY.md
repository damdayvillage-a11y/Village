## API Endpoints (3 new)

### 1. GET /api/media
**Purpose**: Fetch media files with filtering

**Query Parameters**:
- `folder` (optional): Filter by folder name, 'uncategorized', or 'all'
- `type` (optional): Filter by type (image, video, document, all)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "clxxx...",
      "name": "example.jpg",
      "filename": "1729220000-example.jpg",
      "type": "image",
      "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
      "size": 524288,
      "url": "/uploads/1729220000-example.jpg",
      "folder": "products",
      "tags": ["featured", "homepage"],
      "uploadedAt": "2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z",
      "driveId": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Features**:
- Admin authentication required
- Returns up to 100 files
- Ordered by upload date (newest first)
- Efficient database queries

---

### 2. POST /api/media/upload
**Purpose**: Upload files with metadata

**Request**: FormData
- `files`: File array (one or more files)
- `folder` (optional): Folder assignment

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "clxxx...",
      "name": "photo.jpg",
      "filename": "1729220000-photo.jpg",
      "type": "image",
      "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
      "size": 1048576,
      "url": "/uploads/1729220000-photo.jpg",
      "folder": "gallery",
      "tags": [],
      "uploadedAt": "2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Process**:
1. Validate session (admin only)
2. Parse FormData
3. Ensure upload directory exists
4. For each file:
   - Convert to buffer
   - Generate unique filename (timestamp + sanitized name)
   - Write to disk (`public/uploads/`)
   - Detect file type from MIME
   - Create database record
5. Return uploaded files metadata

**File Type Detection**:
```typescript
function getFileType(mimeType: string) {
  if (mimeType.startsWith('image/')) return 'image';
  if (mimeType.startsWith('video/')) return 'video';
  if (mimeType.includes('pdf') || 
      mimeType.includes('document') || 
      mimeType.includes('word')) return 'document';
  return 'other';
}
```

**Filename Sanitization**:
- Replaces non-alphanumeric chars with underscore
- Preserves extension
- Adds timestamp prefix for uniqueness

**Storage**:
- Directory: `public/uploads/`
- Auto-created if missing
- Files served statically via Next.js

---

### 3. DELETE /api/media/[id]
**Purpose**: Delete file from system

**Parameters**:
- `id`: Media file ID

**Process**:
1. Validate session (admin only)
2. Fetch media record from database
3. Delete file from disk (if exists)
4. Delete database record
5. Return success

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Error Handling**:
- 401: Unauthorized (not admin)
- 404: File not found in database
- 500: Delete operation failed

**Safety**:
- Checks file existence before deletion
- No error if file already removed from disk
- Database always cleaned up

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

Uses existing `Media` model:
```prisma
model Media {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  name       String
  filename   String
  type       String   // 'image', 'video', 'document', 'other'
  mimeType   String
  size       Int
  url        String
  folder     String?
  tags       String[]
  driveId    String?
  uploadedAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### File System Structure

```
public/
â””â”€â”€ uploads/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 1729220000-example.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ 1729220001-document.pdf
    â””â”€â”€ 1729220002-video.mp4
```

### Security Features
