## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No bookings found" or "No reviews found"
**This is NORMAL if:**
- Fresh installation with no data
- Database just seeded with only admin/host users

**Solution:**
- This is correct behavior - not a bug
- Create test data:
  ```bash
  # Create test booking
  # Create test review
  # Then check admin panel again
  ```

### Issue: Still seeing "coming soon..."
**This means:**
- Old code is still deployed
- Need to rebuild and redeploy

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild container
git pull
docker build -t village-app .
# Redeploy to CapRover
```

### Issue: API errors in console
**Check these:**
1. Database connection working? `npm run db:test`
2. Prisma client generated? `npx prisma generate`
3. Migrations applied? `npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. Environment variables set correctly?

## üìä API Endpoint Verification

Test these endpoints directly (use browser or curl):

### 1. Stats API
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/stats
```
**Expected:** JSON with statistics (not mock data)

### 2. Activity API
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/activity
```
**Expected:** JSON with activities array

### 3. Bookings API
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/bookings
```
**Expected:** JSON with bookings array (may be empty)

### 4. Reviews API
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/reviews?hasComment=true
```
**Expected:** JSON with reviews array (may be empty)

All should return 200 status (or 401 if not authenticated).
